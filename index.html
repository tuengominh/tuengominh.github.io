    <p>I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tue-m-ngo-2b544489/">Tue M. Ngo,</a> an infinite learner from Saigon and currently based in Barcelona.</p>
    <p>Possessing a multi-disciplinary background, I am confident in leveraging my understanding of human behaviors and emerging technologies to connect the dots, to bridge the gaps, and to create impacts across various segments.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am actively seeking an opportunity to deepen my knowledge and gain hands-on experience in the fields of biomimetic cognitive systems, modular robotics, tangible user interfaces, and technology-enhanced experiences. I am also leaning towards being a part of the community of anti-disciplinary social innovators, software craftsmen, digital artists, and makers.</p>
    <p>This website is used to document my journey <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tinkering.html">becoming self-taught</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/project.html">building (almost) anything</a>. If you have any interesting projects to discuss, feel free to shoot me an <a href="mailto:tue.ngominh@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
