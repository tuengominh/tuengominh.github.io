    <p>I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tue-m-ngo-2b544489/">Tue M. Ngo</a>, born and raised in Saigon :vietnam:, adopted by Barcelona :es: and currently based in Nijmegen :netherlands:.</p>
    <p>Possessing a multi-disciplinary background, I am confident in integrating various theoretical, computational, experimental and technological techniques to conduct diverse scientific and engineering projects, as long as they're inspriring and enjoyable.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am interested in topics such as biomimetic adaptive systems, neuromorphic engineering, modular robotics and bits-to-atoms computation. I am also leaning towards being part of a community of anti-disciplinary software craftsmen and makers.</p>
